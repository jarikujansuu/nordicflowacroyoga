*"In acroyoga, the most important thing for me is the joy of working together, 
being in the moment and finding balance."* 
**- Karoliina**

Acroyoga is a holistic practice. It increases muscle fitness and stretch and improves overall 
sportiveness. In acroyoga, the goal is to reach a flow state, where the couple doing acroyoga 
moves seamlessly and harmoniously. At its best, acroyoga is a nonverbal dialogue; sensing and 
responding to the movements of another body.

Acroyoga most commonly has three roles: flyer, base and spotter. Flying teaches courage and 
confidence. In the role of base, you learn to support the flyer and give him or she support. 
Spotter plays an important role in ensuring the safety of the flyer and the base. Usually we 
practice all of the tree roles, but there is also the opportunity to specialize as a flyer or a base.

In class, we usually do exercises both with the whole group and in pairs. In the classes, we do 
body awareness and mobility exercises, hand standing, creative movement, games and enjoy each others company.

Acroyoga is a fun practice where can go deep into the moment, in contact with another person. Encouraging 
each other and appreciating each otherâ€™s own movement.
