Acroyoga is an inspiring, energizing and community-building practice that develops body control, balance 
and mobility. It combines the playfulness of acrobatics and pair work with  movements, presence and 
breathing familiar from yoga.

**Nordic Flow Acroyoga**'s aim is to strengthen the connection with each other through acroyoga. 
Teachers â€™diverse backgrounds in yoga, dance, bodyweight training, and pedagogy create diverse 
opportunities for safe and inspiring practice.
