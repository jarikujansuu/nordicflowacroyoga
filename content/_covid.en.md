We have reduced group sizes and mainly work on courses in groups of 3-4 people. If the entire course has to be 
canceled, the money will be refunded.

### As a participant, you can consider the following:
Remember your own hand hygiene by washing your hands with soap every time you come and go to class.
If you suspect any infection, have symptoms, or have recently traveled to high-risk areas, do not come to class.
The use of a protective mask during classes is permitted.

Follow and follow the instructions of the authorities [thl.fi](https://thl.fi)
