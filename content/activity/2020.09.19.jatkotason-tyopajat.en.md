In advanced workshops, we combine creative Acroyoga Montreal style with fun partner acrobatics. We learn 
new washing machines  focusing on good technique and finding a connection with each other.

The workshops are intended for those who have already done acroyoga. Each workshop has its own themes and 
pre-requisites, which helps to ensure that you get the most out of the workshop and that training is safe.
