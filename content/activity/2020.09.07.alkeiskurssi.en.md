This autumn acroyoga course is intended for beginners, but is also well suited for those 
who have already tried a bit of the sport. In the course you will get a package of basic 
techniques of acroyoga as well as exercises that develop body awareness and mobility. You 
can come to the course alone or with a friend, the exercises are done in pairs and in small 
groups. This course is also a great opportunity to get to know others interested in acroyoga 
and find new training buddies. It is important for us to create safe and encouraging experience 
possible for everyone on the course. Welcome!
