Saija is an Acroyoga Montreal and Ryt 200 certified Hatha, Hatha Vinyasa and Yin yoga teacher. 
In both yoga and acroyoga, Saija is fascinated by the vitality, energy and connection that comes from 
them, as well as the softness and breathing of movement. At its best, exercise is insightful, learning, 
and gentle doing without a sense of accomplishment. Communication, presence and a safe and happy 
atmosphere are the themes that Saija wants to bring out as a teacher.
