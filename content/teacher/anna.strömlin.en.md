Anna has been practicing acroyoga since 2015. She has learned from many acroyoga teachers, 
including Jeppe Skovgaard, Jill Cambell, Heidi Blais and Daniel Scott. She is also a special education 
teacher. In my opinion, the best thing about acroyoga is that it can be a goal-oriented sport, relaxed 
play and interactive contact with another person at the same time. It is important for Anna to take 
into account the different needs of the participants and she strives to create a gentle and present 
atmosphere in her classes.
