We are passionate, heartfelt practitioners of acroyoga and versatile movement. **Nordic Flow Acroyoga**'s 
starting point is to strengthen the connection with each other through acroyoga. Teachers diverse 
backgrounds in yoga, dance, weight training, and pedagogy create diverse opportunities for safe and 
inspiring doing. For us it’s important to make acroyoga accessible to everyone.

_“We want acro yoga for everyone. Ordinay and athletic, soft and sinewy, clumsy and supple, introverted, 
crackling, long chunks, quiet, shy and laughing, of all shapes and ages.”_
